# The Impact of Intergovernmental Transfers on Local Revenue Generation: Evidence from Brazil

## Abstract 
In this work, I examine the causal effect of higher transfer revenues on local governments’ tax collection efforts in Brazil. I exploit plausibly exogenous variation in the allocation mechanism of federal funds at the municipal level to estimate the effect of federal grants on locally generated revenues, using a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design. In addition, I examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects based on the fiscal capacity of municipalities.

The findings show that exogenous shifts in federal transfers are associated with lower levels of local revenue generation. Furthermore, the analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects reveals distinct response patterns across regional and economic measures – the impact of federal transfers on revenues is more pronounced in municipalities located in Brazil’s wealthier regions and in more economically developed municipalities. The findings are consistent with Brooks & Phillips’ (2010) theory of fiscal capacity.
