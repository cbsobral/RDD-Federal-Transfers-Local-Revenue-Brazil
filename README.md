# The Impact of Intergovernmental Transfers on Local Revenue Generation: Evidence from Brazil

## Abstract 
This study investigates the causal relationship between increased transfer revenues and the tax collection efforts of local governments in Brazil. The research utilizes a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design to assess the impact of federal grants on locally generated revenues, leveraging the arguably exogenous variation in the allocation of federal funds at the municipal level. The study also delves into the heterogeneity of treatment effects, focusing on the fiscal capacity of municipalities.

The results suggest that exogenous changes in federal transfers correspond with decreased levels of local revenue generation. A detailed examination of heterogeneous treatment effects uncovers unique response patterns across different regional and economic measures. The influence of federal transfers on revenues is particularly evident in municipalities situated in Brazilâ€™s wealthier regions and in economically developed municipalities. These findings align with the theory of fiscal capacity proposed by Brooks & Phillips (2010).
